	abstract = {We present the exclusive analysis of the reactions p + p \ensuremath{\rightarrow} Y + Δ++/( p + π + ) + K 0 , where Y stands for the Λ or Σ 0 hyperon. The proton-proton measurement was performed with the HADES setup at GSI, Darmstadt, at a kinetic beam energy of 3.5 GeV. A dedicated sideband technique allows to reproduce the non-strange background and its kinematics in the selected data sample. Therefore, it is possible to obtain the background subtracted missing mass distribution MM( p π + π + π − ), where we can separate the Λ from the Σ 0 channel. From a Monte Carlo simulation of possible reactions we see contributions also by the reactions p + p \ensuremath{\rightarrow} Σ + /Σ(1385) + + p + K 0 . The ongoing analysis should provide exclusive cross sections of the mentioned reactions and their angular distributions.},

	abstract = {The ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment at CERN) collaboration plans an upgrade of the detector during the second long shutdown of the LHC, during which the interaction rate will be increased to 50 kHz for Pb-Pb collisions. This demands operation of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) in an ungated continuous mode. A gating grid can not be used to prevent ions drifting back into the drift volume. Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) offer intrinsic suppression of the ion backflow. To keep distortions due to space-charge at a manageable level an ion yield of 10 to 20 back drifting ions per incoming electron is required. In this manuscript, we describe the concept of ion backflow suppression with our triple GEM prototype. Within a detailed gas study, we show our lowest ion backflow values for several different gas mixtures that have been considered for the TPC upgrade. These values have been compared with detailed simulations using ANSYS and Garfield++. Within the scope of this study, a large impact of 
space-charges on the ion backflow has been observed. Systematic measurements over a wide range of charge densities, for different field configurations and different drift gaps have been carried out.},

	abstract = {ALICE at the LHC at CERN is planning a major upgrade of the central barrel detectors, including the TPC, to cope with an increase of the LHC luminosity after 2018. A prototype of an ALICE TPC Inner Read-Out Chamber (IROC) was equipped with three large-size Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils as amplification stage to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing the current readout by Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) with such technology. The GEM IROC was installed within a test field cage with a drift length of 115 mm and commissioned with radioactive sources. The d E /d x resolution of the prototype was evaluated in a test beam campaign at the CERN PS and is comparable to the resolution of the MWPC IROC. Stability under LHC conditions was tested during the ALICE p-Pb beam time, when the prototype was mounted underneath LHC beam pipe, close to the interaction point.},

	abstract = {We search for the most basic kaonic nuclear state, K-pp, by studying an exclusive p + p \ensuremath{\rightarrow}p + Λ+ K+ process at Tp = 3.1 GeV using FOPI apparatus at GSI, Darmstadt, Germany. A possible signature of the K-pp is searched as a p+p \ensuremath{\rightarrow}K-pp + K+ \ensuremath{\rightarrow}p+Λ+K+ reaction in the event sample of pΛK+ three body process. A missing-mass ΔM(pK+) spectrum, a Λp invariant-mass M(Λp) spectrum and a mono energetic kaon will characterize such a two body process. The reaction channel is basically the same as the one which T. Yamazaki et al. very recently reported a possible hint of such state with M = 2267 MeV/c2 and Γ= 118 MeV from a re-analysis of the DISTO experiment data. The DISTO data was taken at Tp = 2.85 GeV. The beam energy of the FOPI experiment is chosen to optimize the signal to background ratio and also to see the background shape separately. FOPI data taking took place in August-September 2009 and analysis is currently undergoing.},

	abstract = {We report on high acceptance di-electron spectrometer (HADES) measurements of strange hadrons in the collision systems Ar(1.756 AGeV)+KCl and p+p at 3.5 GeV. Comparisons of K 0 s transverse mass and rapidity spectra to IQMD transport model calculations give a strong hint to a repulsive kaon--nucleon potential. The effect of the potential shows up strongest at very low transverse momenta, which were measured by HADES with high statistics. Statistical model fits show a fair agreement to the particle yields measured in the heavy-ion data, apart from the Ξ − yield which is off by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, first results from the Σ(1385) + reconstruction in p+p reactions are presented, showing an excellent agreement with published data.},
