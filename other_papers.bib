	abstract = {The recent past witnesses the growing interdependence between the physics of hadrons, the physics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and the physics of compact objects in astrophysics. A notable example is the kaon which plays special roles in all the three fields. In this paper, we first review the various theoretical investigations of kaon properties in nuclear medium, focusing on possible uncertainties in each model. We then present a detailed transport model study of kaon production in heavy-ion collisions at \{SIS\} energies. We shall discuss especially the elementary kaon and antikaon production cross sections in hadron-hadron interactions, that represent one of the most serious uncertainties in the transport model study of particle production in heavy-ion collisions. The main purpose of such a study is to constrain kaon in-medium properties from the heavy-ion data. This can provide useful guidances for the development of theoretical models of the kaon in medium. In the last part of the paper, we apply the kaon in-medium properties extracted from heavy-ion data to the study of neutron star properties. Based on a conventional equation of state of nuclear matter that can be considered as one of the best constrained by available experimental data on finite nuclei, we find that the maximum mass of neutron stars is about 2M⊙, which is reduced to about 1.5M⊙ once kaon condensation as constrained by heavy-ion data is introduced. },

However, neutron star observations such as the recently observed pulsar \{PSR\} J1614-2230 with a mass of 1.97 ± 0.04 M ⊙ help to considerably constrain the hadronic equation of state (EoS). We systematically investigate the influence of the hyperon potentials on the stiffness of the EoS. We find that they have but little influence on the maximum mass compared to the inclusion of an additional vector-meson mediating repulsive interaction amongst hyperons. The new mass limit can only be reached with this additional meson regardless of the hyperon potentials. Further, we investigate the impact of the nuclear compression modulus and the effective mass of the nucleon at saturation density on the high density regime of the EoS. We show that the maximum mass of purely nucleonic stars is very sensitive to the effective nucleon mass but only very little to the compression modulus. },

@article{Antoniadis1233232,
	abstract = {Introduction Neutron stars with masses above 1.8 solar masses (M☉), possess extreme gravitational fields, which may give rise to phenomena outside general relativity. These strong-field deviations lack experimental confrontation, because they become observable only in tight binaries containing a high-mass pulsar and where orbital decay resulting from emission of gravitational waves can be tested. Understanding the origin of such a system would also help to answer fundamental questions of close-binary evolution. Artist{\textquoteright}s impression of the PSR J0348+0432 system. The compact pulsar (with beams of radio emission) produces a strong distortion of spacetime (illustrated by the green mesh). Conversely, spacetime around its white-dwarf companion (in light blue) is substantially less curved. According to relativistic theories of gravity, the binary system is subject to energy loss by gravitational waves. Methods We report on radio-timing observations of the pulsar J0348+0432 and phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of its white-dwarf companion, which is in a 2.46-hour orbit. We used these to derive the component masses and orbital parameters, infer the system{\textquoteright}s motion, and constrain its age. Results We find that the white dwarf has a mass of 0.172 {\textpm} 0.003 M☉, which, combined with orbital velocity measurements, yields a pulsar mass of 2.01 {\textpm} 0.04 M☉. Additionally, over a span of 2 years, we observed a significant decrease in the orbital period, P˙bobs=-8.6{\textpm}1.4 μs year-1 in our radio-timing data. Discussion Pulsar J0348+0432 is only the second neutron star with a precisely determined mass of 2 M☉ and independently confirms the existence of such massive neutron stars in nature. For these masses and orbital period, general relativity predicts a significant orbital decay, which matches the observed value, P˙bobs/P˙bGR=1.05{\textpm}0.18. The pulsar has a gravitational binding energy 60\% higher than other known neutron stars in binaries where gravitational-wave damping has been detected. Because the magnitude of strong-field deviations generally depends nonlinearly on the binding energy, the measurement of orbital decay transforms the system into a gravitational laboratory for an as-yet untested gravity regime. The consistency of the observed orbital decay with general relativity therefore supports its validity, even for such extreme gravity-matter couplings, and rules out strong-field phenomena predicted by physically well-motivated alternatives. Moreover, our result supports the use of general relativity{\textendash}based templates for the detection of gravitational waves from merger events with advanced ground-based detectors. Lastly, the system provides insight into pulsar-spin evolution after mass accretion. Because of its short merging time scale of 400 megayears, the system is a direct channel for the formation of an ultracompact x-ray binary, possibly leading to a pulsar-planet system or the formation of a black hole. Because of their extremely high densities, massive neutron stars can be used to test gravity. Based on spectroscopy of its white dwarf companion, Antoniadis et al. (p. 448) identified a millisecond pulsar as a neutron star twice as heavy as the Sun. The observed binary{\textquoteright}s orbital decay is consistent with that predicted by general relativity, ruling out previously untested strong-field phenomena predicted by alternative theories. The binary system has a peculiar combination of properties and poses a challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution. Many physically motivated extensions to general relativity (GR) predict substantial deviations in the properties of spacetime surrounding massive neutron stars. We report the measurement of a 2.01 {\textpm} 0.04 solar mass (M☉) pulsar in a 2.46-hour orbit with a 0.172 {\textpm} 0.003 M☉ white dwarf. The high pulsar mass and the compact orbit make this system a sensitive laboratory of a previously untested strong-field gravity regime. Thus far, the observed orbital decay agrees with GR, supporting its validity even for the extreme conditions present in the system. The resulting constraints on deviations support the use of GR-based templates for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the system strengthens recent constraints on the properties of dense matter and provides insight to binary stellar astrophysics and pulsar recycling.},

In order to solve this problem, a multi-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) is introduced as a model for the universal many-body repulsion in baryonic systems on the basis of the Extended Soft Core (ESC) baryon-baryon interaction. The strength of MPP is determined by analyzing the nucleus-nucleus scattering with the G-matrix folding model. The interactions in $\Lambda$N , $\Sigma$N and $\Xi$N channels are shown to be consistent with experimental indications. The EoS in neutron-star matter with hyperon mixing is obtained from ESC in addition of MPP, and mass-radius relations of neutron stars are derived. The maximum mass is shown to reach 2M⊙ even in the case of including hyperon mixing on the basis of model-parameters determined by terrestrial experiments.},

	abstract = {Results on \{K0\} and Λ production in p↑p interactions at 6 GeV are presented. The data are from an exposure of the Argonne 12 ft bubble chamber to a 60\% transversely polarized proton beam. Results include data on Λ and \{K0\} inclusive production, and on the reactions p↑p \ensuremath{\rightarrow} pΛK+(pΣ0K+). The beam asymmetry parameter for p↑p \ensuremath{\rightarrow} K0(K0) + X is determined to be (−0.52 ± 0.12). },

@article{Alpgard1976349,
	abstract = {The inclusive reaction pp \ensuremath{\rightarrow} Λ + X++ at 19 GeV/c beam momentum has been analyzed in terms of the triple-Regge formalism. A good description of the structure function is achieved for events with |t| \&lt; 4 (GeV/c)2. The effective trajectory obtained from fits to the M2/s distribution in different t bins is αR (t) = −(0.38 ± 0.11) + (1.15 ± 0.07)t, which holds up to a |t| value of 4 (GeV/c)2. This is consistent with the K trajectory rather than the K\ensuremath{\asterisk} trajectory which has been reported from other experiments. },

It is shown that a one-pion-exchange model exciting these isobars reproduces well the ratio of the production cross sections. The consequences for this and other channels are discussed.},
