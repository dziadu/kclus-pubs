	abstract = {The recent past witnesses the growing interdependence between the physics of hadrons, the physics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and the physics of compact objects in astrophysics. A notable example is the kaon which plays special roles in all the three fields. In this paper, we first review the various theoretical investigations of kaon properties in nuclear medium, focusing on possible uncertainties in each model. We then present a detailed transport model study of kaon production in heavy-ion collisions at \{SIS\} energies. We shall discuss especially the elementary kaon and antikaon production cross sections in hadron-hadron interactions, that represent one of the most serious uncertainties in the transport model study of particle production in heavy-ion collisions. The main purpose of such a study is to constrain kaon in-medium properties from the heavy-ion data. This can provide useful guidances for the development of theoretical models of the kaon in medium. In the last part of the paper, we apply the kaon in-medium properties extracted from heavy-ion data to the study of neutron star properties. Based on a conventional equation of state of nuclear matter that can be considered as one of the best constrained by available experimental data on finite nuclei, we find that the maximum mass of neutron stars is about 2M⊙, which is reduced to about 1.5M⊙ once kaon condensation as constrained by heavy-ion data is introduced. },

Using the SU(3) × SU(3) chiral lagrangian to model meson-baryon interactions it is found that baryonic matter acquires a strangeness-per-baryon ratio approaching one at several times nuclear density.

The three-body interactions of nucleons and hyperons determine the stiffness of the neutron star equation of state and thereby the maximum neutron star mass. Two-body hyperon--nucleon and hyperon--hyperon interactions give rise to hyperon pairing which exponentially suppresses cooling of neutron stars via the direct hyperon \{URCA\} processes. Nonmesonic weak reactions with hyperons in dense neutron star matter govern the gravitational wave emissions due to the r-mode instability of rotating neutron stars. },

However, neutron star observations such as the recently observed pulsar \{PSR\} J1614-2230 with a mass of 1.97 ± 0.04 M ⊙ help to considerably constrain the hadronic equation of state (EoS). We systematically investigate the influence of the hyperon potentials on the stiffness of the EoS. We find that they have but little influence on the maximum mass compared to the inclusion of an additional vector-meson mediating repulsive interaction amongst hyperons. The new mass limit can only be reached with this additional meson regardless of the hyperon potentials. Further, we investigate the impact of the nuclear compression modulus and the effective mass of the nucleon at saturation density on the high density regime of the EoS. We show that the maximum mass of purely nucleonic stars is very sensitive to the effective nucleon mass but only very little to the compression modulus. },

According to relativistic theories of gravity, the binary system is subject to energy loss by gravitational waves. Methods We report on radio-timing observations of the pulsar J0348+0432 and phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of its white-dwarf companion, which is in a 2.46-hour orbit. We used these to derive the component masses and orbital parameters, infer the system{\textquoteright}s motion, and constrain its age. Results We find that the white dwarf has a mass of 0.172 {\textpm} 0.003 M☉, which, combined with orbital velocity measurements, yields a pulsar mass of 2.01 {\textpm} 0.04 M☉. Additionally, over a span of 2 years, we observed a significant decrease in the orbital period, P˙bobs=-8.6{\textpm}1.4 μs year-1 in our radio-timing data. Discussion Pulsar J0348+0432 is only the second neutron star with a precisely determined mass of 2 M☉ and independently confirms the existence of such massive neutron stars in nature. For these masses and orbital period, general relativity predicts a significant orbital decay, which matches the observed value, P˙bobs/P˙bGR=1.05{\textpm}0.18. The pulsar has a gravitational binding energy 60\% higher than other known neutron stars in binaries where gravitational-wave damping has been detected. Because the magnitude of strong-field deviations generally depends nonlinearly on the binding energy, the measurement of orbital decay transforms the system into a gravitational laboratory for an as-yet untested gravity regime. The consistency of the observed orbital decay with general relativity therefore supports its validity, even for such extreme gravity-matter couplings, and rules out strong-field phenomena predicted by physically well-motivated alternatives. Moreover, our result supports the use of general relativity{\textendash}based templates for the detection of gravitational waves from merger events with advanced ground-based detectors. Lastly, the system provides insight into pulsar-spin evolution after mass accretion. Because of its short merging time scale of 400 megayears, the system is a direct channel for the formation of an ultracompact x-ray binary, possibly leading to a pulsar-planet system or the formation of a black hole. Because of their extremely high densities, massive neutron stars can be used to test gravity. Based on spectroscopy of its white dwarf companion, Antoniadis et al. (p. 448) identified a millisecond pulsar as a neutron star twice as heavy as the Sun. The observed binary{\textquoteright}s orbital decay is consistent with that predicted by general relativity, ruling out previously untested strong-field phenomena predicted by alternative theories. The binary system has a peculiar combination of properties and poses a challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution. Many physically motivated extensions to general relativity (GR) predict substantial deviations in the properties of spacetime surrounding massive neutron stars. We report the measurement of a 2.01 {\textpm} 0.04 solar mass (M☉) pulsar in a 2.46-hour orbit with a 0.172 {\textpm} 0.003 M☉ white dwarf. The high pulsar mass and the compact orbit make this system a sensitive laboratory of a previously untested strong-field gravity regime. Thus far, the observed orbital decay agrees with GR, supporting its validity even for the extreme conditions present in the system. The resulting constraints on deviations support the use of GR-based templates for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the system strengthens recent constraints on the properties of dense matter and provides insight to binary stellar astrophysics and pulsar recycling.},

	abstract = {Neutron stars with large masses ∼ 2M⊙ require the hard stiffness of equation of state (EoS) of neutron-star matter. On the other hand, hyperon mixing brings about remarkable softening of EoS. In order to solve this problem, a multi-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) is introduced as a model for the universal many-body repulsion in baryonic systems on the basis of the Extended Soft Core (ESC) baryon-baryon interaction. The strength of MPP is determined by analyzing the nucleus-nucleus scattering with the G-matrix folding model. The interactions in $\Lambda$N , $\Sigma$N and $\Xi$N channels are shown to be consistent with experimental indications. The EoS in neutron-star matter with hyperon mixing is obtained from ESC in addition of MPP, and mass-radius relations of neutron stars are derived. The maximum mass is shown to reach 2M⊙ even in the case of including hyperon mixing on the basis of model-parameters determined by terrestrial experiments.},

These processes range from the generation of hyperons to quark deconfinement to the formation of kaon condensates and H-matter. There are theoretical suggestions of even more exotic processes inside neutron stars, such as the formation of absolutely stable strange quark matter, a configuration of matter even more stable than the most stable atomic nucleus, iron. In the latter event, neutron stars would be largely composed of pure quark matter, eventually enveloped in a thin nuclear crust. No matter which physical processes are actually realized inside neutron stars, each one leads to fingerprints, some more pronounced than others though, in the observable stellar quantities. This feature combined with the unprecedented progress in observational astronomy, which allows us to see vistas with remarkable clarity that previously were only imagined, renders neutron stars nearly ideal probes for a wide range of physical studies, including the role of strangeness in dense matter.},

	abstract = {We formulate a covariant transport approach for high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions where the real part of the nucleon self-energies is fitted to nuclear-matter properties which are evaluated on the basis of a NJL-type Lagrangian for the quark degrees of freedom. The parameters of the quark-model Lagrangian are fixed by the Gell-Mann, Oakes and Renner relation, the pion-nucleon Σ-term, the nucleon energy as well as the nuclear binding energy at saturation density ϱ0. We find the resulting scalar and vector self-energies for nucleons to be well in line with either Dirac-Brueckner computations for ϱ ⩽ 2ϱ0 or those from the phenomenological optical potential when accounting for a swelling of the nucleon at finite nuclear-matter density. The meson-baryon interaction density is modeled to describe a decrease of the meson mass with baryon density. The imaginary part of the hadron self-energies is determined by a string fragmentation model which accounts for the in-medium mass of hadrons in line with the {\lq}chiral{\rq} dynamics employed. The applicability of the transport approach is demonstrated in comparison with experimental data from \{SIS\} to \{SPS\} energie The enhancement of the K+π+ ratio in A + A collisions compared to p + A reactions at \{AGS\} energies is reproduced within the {\lq}chiral{\rq} dynamics.

	abstract = {We review the constraints imposed by the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of the \{QCD\} vacuum on the hadron properties at finite temperature T and baryon density ρB. A restoration of chiral symmetry is indicated by the dropping of the scalar quark condensate q̄q at finite T and ρB in various approaches. This suggests the hadrons to become approximately massless in hot and dense nuclear matter or the vector and axial vector currents to become equal. In this respect we study the properties of hadrons -- as produced in relativistic nucleus--nucleus collisions -- by means of a covariant hadronic transport approach where scalar and vector hadron self-energies are taken into account explicitly which are modelled in terms of effective {\lq}chiral{\rq} Lagrangians. Within this transport approach we investigate the reaction dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and analyse experimental data on π, η, K+, K−, ρ, ω, φ, p̄ and charmonium production for proton--nucleus and nucleus--nucleus collisions from \{SIS\} to \{SPS\} energies (1--200A GeV). Whereas π, η and to some extent K+ mesons are found not to change their properties in the nuclear medium substantially, antiprotons and antikaons do show sizeable attractive self-energies as can be extracted from their experimental abundancies and spectra. The properties of the vector mesons ρ, ω and φ at finite baryon density are investigated by their dileptonic decay; the \{CERES\} and HELIOS-3 data at \{SPS\} energies are found to be incompatible with a {\lq}bare{\rq} vector meson mass scenario. Here, a description by {\lq}dropping{\rq} ρ and ω masses leads to a very good reproduction of the data, however, also approaches based on more conventional hadronic interactions as pion polarizations and meson--nucleon scattering amplitudes are compatible with the present dilepton spectra at \{SPS\} energies. Constraints from dilepton studies at BEVALAC/SIS energies are investigated in all decay schemes as well as a variety of further observables that allow to disentangle the different scenarios experimentally. Furthermore, the charmonium production and suppression in proton--nucleus and nucleus--nucleus collisions is investigated within the transport approach in order to probe a possible transition to a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase. We finally discuss {\lq}optimized{\rq} observables for an experimental investigation of the restoration of chiral symmetry and/or the phase transition to a quark-gluon plasma. },

We start out with a survey of the present status of nuclear matter calculations and of kinetic theories as far as they are of importance for our approach. We then present a detailed derivation of the quantum molecular dynamics equation, discuss the various approximations necessary to derive this equation and to make actual calculations feasible. The calculations presented aim at the solution of two of the most interesting questions of contemporary heavy ion physics: What causes a nucleus to fragment into many heavy pieces, and can we determine the nuclear equation of state from heavy ion reactions? We first make detailed comparisons with a multitude of experimental data, which yield unexpectedly good agreement. We then proceed to detailed investigations of these questions. We find that fragmentation at these energies is triggered by the density wave caused by the projectile while travelling through the target. We reproduce the ``squeeze out'' and the ``bounce off'' predicted by hydrodynamical calculations and recently seen in experiment. Thus there is hope that the nuclear equation of state can be extracted from heavy ion experiments. However, very careful multiparameter experiments are necessary before one can achieve this goal. },

It is shown that the same predictions can be obtained with several -- numerically completely different and independently written -- programs as far as the same model parameters are employed and the same basic approximations are made. Many observables are robust against variations of the details of the model assumptions used. Some of the physical results, however, depend also on rather technical parameters like the preparation of the initial configuration in phase space. This crucial problem is connected with the description of the ground state of single nuclei, which differs among the various approaches.

Implications for the subthreshold production of kaons and antikaons in heavy-ion collisions are discussed. On the mean-field level we find only small in-medium corrections for the relevant kaon production processes. The production of kaons is even less favourable at high density due to repulsive vector interactions. We conclude that one has to go beyond the mean-field level and take fluctuations and secondary production processes via resonances into account to explain the recently observed enhancement of kaon production at subthreshold energies. The situation is different for antikaons where in-medium effects strongly enhance their production rates. We also see strong in-medium modifications of the absorption processes for antikaons and Λ's which might be visible in flow measurements. We predict that at high density the threshold energy for antikaon and Λ production as well as for the annihilation become equal leading to similar numbers of antikaons and Λ's in the dense zone of a relativistic heavy-ion collision. },

At the order considered there are contributions from one- and two-pseudoscalar-meson exchange diagrams and from four-baryon contact terms without and with two derivatives. SU(3) flavor symmetry is imposed for constructing the hyperon--nucleon interaction, however, the explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking by the physical masses of the pseudoscalar mesons (π, K, η) and of the involved baryons is taken into account. An excellent description of the hyperon--nucleon system can be achieved at next-to-leading order. It is on the same level of quality as the one obtained by the most advanced phenomenological hyperon--nucleon interaction models. },

@article{Hen614,
	abstract = {Atomic nuclei consist of fermions{\textemdash}protons and neutrons{\textemdash}bound together by interactions. Because two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, both protons and neutrons have a broad range of momenta inside the nucleus. Hen et al. scattered electrons off nuclei of varying sizes to study the distribution of the protons{\textquoteright} and neutrons{\textquoteright} momenta. Protons formed high-momentum pairs with neutrons much more frequently than with other protons. Thus, surprisingly, the average momentum of a neutron was lower than that of a proton, even in nuclei with a larger number of neutrons than protons.Science, this issue p. 614The atomic nucleus is composed of two different kinds of fermions: protons and neutrons. If the protons and neutrons did not interact, the Pauli exclusion principle would force the majority of fermions (usually neutrons) to have a higher average momentum. Our high-energy electron-scattering measurements using 12C, 27Al, 56Fe, and 208Pb targets show that even in heavy, neutron-rich nuclei, short-range interactions between the fermions form correlated high-momentum neutron-proton pairs. Thus, in neutron-rich nuclei, protons have a greater probability than neutrons to have momentum greater than the Fermi momentum. This finding has implications ranging from nuclear few-body systems to neutron stars and may also be observable experimentally in two-spin{\textendash}state, ultracold atomic gas systems.},
